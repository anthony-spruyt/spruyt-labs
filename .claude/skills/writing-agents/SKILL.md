## Description Field

**Syntax:** Single line with `\n` for newlines. Wrap in `'...'` if contains `#` after whitespace.

**Write in third person** — the description is injected into the system prompt by the routing system.

**Content pattern:** Brief capability statement (1 clause), then triggering conditions. Don't expand the capability statement into a workflow summary: the description rides in every parent request and is all the parent sees when deciding to delegate, while the body loads only when the agent runs. Keep "what" to a single clause, put process details in the body.

**Include:**

- "When to use" conditions, written as categories of intent rather than sample phrasings
- "When NOT to use" boundaries, naming the agent or command to use instead

Leave `<example>` dialogue out of the description. The parent reads it on every request as routing signal, and sample exchanges anchor delegation to the phrasings they show; the intent categories carry the same signal. Worked examples the agent itself needs go in the body.

See `references/project-patterns.md` Section 6 for the template.

## System Prompt Structure

Canonical section order for this project:

1. **Persona/Role** — Expert identity with domain expertise, 1-2 sentences
2. **Core Responsibilities** — Numbered, 3-5 items
3. **Mandatory Gates** — Issue requirements, input validation
4. **Classification/Detection** — Change-type analysis, input categorization
5. **Workflow Steps** — The main process
6. **Output Format** — Structured template (verdict header, evidence, next steps)
7. **Handoff Protocol** — How results return to caller
8. **Rules** — Constraints the model would otherwise get wrong, each with its reason
9. **Agent Definition Feedback** — The agent ends its final reply to the caller with an `### Agent Definition Feedback` section: each problem as `- [definition] <what happened> → <change to its own file>`, `- [rules] <what happened> → <change to CLAUDE.md, .claude/rules/<file> or the hook>` or `- [brief] <what happened> → <what the caller's brief should have said>`. Tag `[definition]` if it would recur under any reasonable brief and comes from the agent file; `[rules]` if it comes from `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/` or a hook; otherwise `[brief]`. Suggest only; never self-edit. Copy the wording from an existing agent. Don't use `memory`: settings disable auto memory. Skip it when a machine parses the output (renovate-pr-analyzer feeds n8n)

Not every agent needs all sections. Small focused agents may only need Persona, Workflow, Rules, and Output Format.

**Output format:** Agents feeding orchestrators use rigid parseable formats. Standalone agents use human-readable reports. See `references/project-patterns.md` Section 4.

**Handoff patterns:** Choose from: GitHub issue comment, structured return to caller, terminal states (SUCCESS/ROLLBACK/PARTIAL), or fix-and-retry loop. See `references/project-patterns.md` Section 5.

## Creation Workflow

Write the agent in the main session. Use one fresh-context sub-agent for review, so the reviewer isn't anchored on drafting choices.

### Phase 1: Create

Read the agent requirements, this skill, existing agents (for pattern reference), and all inherited context files (CLAUDE.md, `.claude/rules/*`). Then:

1. **Discover patterns** — Read 2-3 existing agents in `.claude/agents/` for local conventions
2. **Define persona** — Expert identity with domain expertise, 1-2 sentences
3. **Write frontmatter** — Description complying with the Description Field section of this skill (under 1024 chars, no workflow summary, no `<example>` dialogue, "When to use" and "When NOT to use" sections). Choose model, effort, and tools (model and effort — `references/project-patterns.md` Section 2; least privilege — `references/anthropic-best-practices.md` Section 9)
4. **Structure system prompt** — Follow section order from System Prompt Structure above. Include output format template and handoff protocol
5. **Calibrate freedom** — High freedom for judgment calls, low freedom for exact commands (see `references/anthropic-best-practices.md` Section 2)
6. **Scope-limit** — If testing shows over-reach, add "Only make changes directly requested." (see `references/anthropic-best-practices.md` Section 4)
7. **Safety gates** — Identify destructive or externally-visible operations. Add confirmation gates for irreversible actions. For hard-stop gates, state the stop unconditionally with its reason and a named end state (e.g., "stop and return BLOCKED: <reason>"). Add "stop on error" for sequential workflows
8. **Calibrate emphasis** — Same rules as Optimization Phase 1 step 4
9. **Avoid inherited duplication** — Read CLAUDE.md and `.claude/rules/*`. Do not duplicate content. Use single-line references (e.g., "Follow inherited secret handling rules")
10. **Size check** — Run `wc -l` and `wc -w`. Past ~300 lines / 2,000 words, re-test each section against `references/anthropic-best-practices.md` Section 1; length alone is not a reason to cut

### Phase 2: Review (one sub-agent)

Dispatch one fresh sub-agent with the new file, this skill, and the inherited context files. It checks:

- **Structure**: frontmatter fields, description under 1024 chars, no workflow summary, no `<example>` dialogue, emphasis calibrated, output format and handoff protocol present.
- **Completeness**: The System Prompt Structure sections this agent needs are present (at minimum: Persona, Workflow, Rules, Output Format). No inherited context duplicated. No explanations of what the model already knows. Domain-specific commands have non-obvious flags where needed.

It returns PASS/FAIL with specific issues and exact fixes.

### Phase 3: Fix

Apply the fixes in the main session. Re-run Phase 2 only when a fix changed behavior (workflow, gates, tools), not for wording.

## Optimization Workflow

Optimize in the main session. Use one fresh-context sub-agent for review, so the reviewer has no sunk cost in the cuts.

### Phase 1: Optimize

Read the agent file, this skill, and all inherited context files (CLAUDE.md, `.claude/rules/*`). Then:

1. **Measure** — Count lines (`wc -l`) and words (`wc -w`). Identify largest sections
2. **Fix description field** — Must comply with the Description Field section of this skill:
   - Under 1024 chars (measure and verify). If over: remove workflow summaries and fold near-synonymous triggers into one category
   - No workflow summary (lines like "Handoff flow: X → Y → Z"). Only capability + triggering conditions
   - No `<example>` dialogue. Move any trigger an example carried that the conditions don't already cover into "When to use" or "When NOT to use", then delete the example
   - Must have "When to use" and "When NOT to use" sections
3. **Remove inherited context** — Read CLAUDE.md and every `.claude/rules/` file. Search the agent for duplicated content. Common: secret handling, git staging, research priority, domain substitution. Replace with single-line references (e.g., "Follow inherited secret handling rules")
4. **Calibrate emphasis** — Soften CRITICAL/MUST/NEVER/FORBIDDEN/MANDATORY (see `references/anthropic-best-practices.md` Section 3). Remove explanations the model already knows (Section 12). **Safety gates** (hard stops preventing data loss, secret exposure, skipping required inputs) stay unconditional, stated plainly with their reason. **Operational preferences** (tool choice, workflow ordering, style) use normal language — no bold, no
   CRITICAL, no blockquote emphasis
5. **Cut what fails the test** — Remove what the model already knows, inherited context, and verbose examples (`references/anthropic-best-practices.md` Section 1). Agents are single files; do not extract. **Keep:** domain-specific commands with non-obvious flags, exact commit/git commands, behavioral anchors preventing shallow execution
6. **Verify frontmatter** — All original fields must survive (`name`, `description`, `model`, `effort`, `tools`). Missing `tools` silently grants all tools

### Phase 2: Review (one sub-agent)

Dispatch one fresh sub-agent (no shared context with the optimizer). It reads the optimized file, the original (via `git show <pre-optimization-ref>:<path>`), inherited context files, and this skill, and checks:

- **Structure**: Frontmatter fields survived. Description under 1024 chars, no workflow summary, no `<example>` dialogue. System prompt sections present. Emphasis calibrated (safety gates unconditional with reasons). Output format and handoff protocol present.
- **Effectiveness**: Lost domain-specific knowledge not in inherited context and that the model wouldn't know. All workflow steps still represented. Domain commands with non-obvious flags preserved. Each cut classified SAFE/RISKY/LOST.

It returns PASS/FAIL plus EFFECTIVE/DEGRADED/BROKEN, with specific issues and exact fixes.

### Phase 3: Fix

Apply the fixes in the main session. Re-run Phase 2 only when a fix restored or changed behavior, not for wording.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                          | Fix                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workflow summary in description  | Brief capability + triggering conditions only. Put workflow in body |
| CRITICAL/MANDATORY/NEVER overuse | Normal language. Current models overtrigger on aggressive emphasis |
| Padding in a long system prompt  | Remove what the model already knows; keep facts and reasons          |
| No output format specified       | Add structured output template                                      |
| Example dialogue in description  | Replace with intent categories under "When to use" / "When NOT to use" |
| See full list                    | `references/common-mistakes.md`                                     |
